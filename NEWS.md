# rosetta 0.4 (2023-07-20)

- Resolved some bugs in previous version.
- SEM replaced with LAVAAN for latent variable modeling. 

# rosetta 0.3 (2019-09-02)

- Initial release for manuscript.
- Version 2 allows datasets to have local variables that are not shared by any other dataset.  Note that performance suffers when you add such variables, but we have reason to believe that the method is robust given a suitable amount of data.
